## 4. System Dimension Coverage

| System Dimension              | Test Cases                   | Meaning in this task                                                                   |

## 5. Notes on Unit and System Difference

The unit tests mainly check whether each single module works.

For example:

```text
create account
add transaction
create category
set budget
generate report
create rule
create schedule
```

These functions may be implemented correctly one by one.

The system tests check whether these modules still work correctly after they are connected.

For example:

```text
create account
→ add transaction
→ assign category
→ update budget
→ update report
```

This is harder because the same transaction affects several different parts of the system.

This task is expected to show a gap between unit-level correctness and system-level correctness. A model may pass many unit tests, but still fail when financial data must stay consistent across accounts, categories, budgets, reports, schedules, and rules.

## 6. Reference and Model Verification Plan

The final benchmark should include at least three score reports:

| Solution                  | Expected Role                                    | Report File                                  |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| Reference implementation  | Correct implementation used to verify the rubric | `score_report_reference_unit_system_v1.json` |
| Model or agent solution 1 | First tested model or agent                      | `score_report_model_001_unit_system_v1.json` |
| Model or agent solution 2 | Second tested model or agent                     | `score_report_model_002_unit_system_v1.json` |

The reference implementation should ideally pass all unit and system tests.

Model or agent implementations are expected to show a possible unit-system gap.
